echo ============================================================

rem ============================================================
rem  UCOnline2 patch.bat
rem
rem  Drop a game folder onto this file (or run: patch.bat "C:\path\to\game").
rem
rem  It works out what the game is and does the whole deploy:
rem    * finds the engine (Unity or Unreal) and the real executable
rem    * finds where steam_api64.dll actually lives and installs ours THERE,
rem      backing up the original first
rem    * installs the early overlay proxy as version.dll for Unity or
rem      XINPUT1_3.dll beside the real Unreal shipping executable
rem    * detects Photon / EOS / PlayFab and copies the matching plugin
rem    * writes a union-crax.ini with the right sections
rem
rem  It does NOT modify game assets. Any third-party app IDs (Photon GUIDs,
rem  your own Epic app, a PlayFab TitleId) are YOURS, so it prompts for them
rem  and will happily write a stub section you can fill in later.
rem
rem  DETECTION NOTE: backends are detected by FILE PRESENCE, and for Unreal
rem  also by ANSI module names inside the shipping exe. Deliberately not by
rem  scanning for endpoint strings -- Unreal stores most literals as UTF-16,
rem  so a byte-level search for "playfabapi.com" finds nothing even in a game
rem  that clearly uses it. Module names like OnlineSubsystemEOS are ANSI and
rem  do match. Enum values are avoided as signals for the same reason a plain
rem  "PlayFab" search is useless: a platform-abstraction plugin lists every
rem  provider it could ever target, so the string proves nothing.
